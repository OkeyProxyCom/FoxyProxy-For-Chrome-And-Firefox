To start using FoxyProxy, first, install the extension on your browser. After that, you can start adding proxies and defining patterns. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set it up:

Step 1: Download and install the extension.

First, visit the Chrome Web Store and search for FoxyProxy. Click on the ‘Add to Browser’ button to install the extension.

Step 2: Add Proxies. In the ‘Proxies’ tab, click on ‘Add New Proxy’. This menu may look a little intimidating if you’re not used to manual configuration, but don’t worry because it’s pretty simple to use.

Here, you need to enter the details of your proxy server, including the IP address and port number. You can also assign a favored color to this proxy for easy identification.

Step 3: From the Proxy Details tab, select Manual Proxy Configuration and enter the proxy server information.

The automatic proxy configuration URL comes in handy if you are on a managed school or work network. It configures the proxy server without you having to do anything.

Step 4: Define Patterns. Now navigate to the ‘URL Patterns’ tab and click on ‘Add New Pattern’. In this section, you can define the pattern for the URLs that you want to route through a specific proxy. You can also select the proxy that you want to use for this pattern.

Choose whether you want to whitelist or blacklist the URL you just entered. Blacklisted URLs take precedence over whitelisted URLs.

Step 5: Enable your proxy profile. Click on the extension icon and select: If you want to enable proxy “profile name” for all websites, use proxy “profile name” for all URLs.

If you have configured the proxy to work on specific websites, use the proxy according to predefined patterns and priorities.

That’s it! You’ve successfully set up a proxy server on Chrome using it!

# How to Use FoxyProxy For Firefox?
Step 1: Download and install the extension from the Firefox ADD-ONS store by clicking Add to Firefox.

FoxyProxy for Firefox comes in two versions: FoxyProxy Basic and FoxyProxy Standard. The Standard version offers more useful features, so we will use this version in our guide. As an alternative, if you just want a proxy switcher with on/off switching, you can try the basic version.

Step 2: We can now operate the initial manual proxy configuration. In Firefox’s menu bar, click the proxy icon, and press the Options button – the extension’s settings menu will then open.

Step 3: Click the Add button on the left to add a new proxy configuration. The Add Proxy window will open and we need to fill in the proxy details in the following fields:

Proxy type
Proxy IP address or DNS name
Port
In some cases, you need to use a username and password combination for authorization. Copy the login and password values from the proxy list and paste them into the username and password fields.

Now, click the “Save” button. Then, click on the FoxyProxy icon and select the new proxy configuration – it should now be active. Now you can check whether the proxy is working properly or not: Click on the icon again and select What is my IP? Button, then you can see your new IP address and location.
